# Dataset Description

The Students Performance dataset contains detailed information on 1,000 students. It focuses on their demographic background, parental education level, and performance in three standardized test subjects: math, reading, and writing. This dataset is widely used for exploring the relationships between socioeconomic factors and academic achievement, as well as for building prediction models to understand what influences student performance.

There are 8 columns in total, covering both categorical and numerical variables. The categorical features include gender, race/ethnicity, parental level of education, lunch type, and whether the student completed a test preparation course. The numerical features include scores in math, reading, and writing — each ranging from 0 to 100.
